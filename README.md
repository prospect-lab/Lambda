Lambda is a strict definitive language that is made specifically for transpiling into other programming and scripting
languages such as

This allows you to develop libraries that can be used in many other systems, making it a **Cross-System** library.

### Downloads
You can download binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/prospect-lab/Lambda/releases) section. There are builds for Windows, Linux, macOS
and some other BSD/Unix operating systems, supporting various architectures. The binaries are powered by the preloaders we made using **Go**

### Standards
Currently we are working on the Lambda One standard. Lambda One standard is going to have the common building blocks of *most* programming
languages, such as Variables, Loops, Functions, Procedures, Conditions, IO and Error Handling.
